### Utilization of the Infrastructure Provisioning System (IPS) is recommended.
Management of AWS resources and Helm charts for Kubernetes resources should be done with [workiva.yml](https://github.com/Workiva/wk/blob/master/docs/workiva-yml.md) if possible.

IPS documentation can be found here: https://wiki.atl.workiva.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=176753272
