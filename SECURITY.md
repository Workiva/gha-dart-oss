# gha-dart-oss

This repo contains workflows for linting, unit testing, and publishing dart code. It has a low attack surface.

* Since this repo will open sourced soon, be careful to not check any secrets into source code.
* Since there are a lot of bash commands run in the yaml, be careful for command injection coming from unexpected user input.
